# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents — Claude Code (claude.ai/code) and vendor-neutral tools such as Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, and Copilot — when working with code in this repository.

## Agent instruction files

`CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are kept **byte-identical**. `CLAUDE.md` is what Claude Code reads; `AGENTS.md` is what vendor-neutral agent tools read — Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Copilot, and whatever follows them. Two real files, deliberately not a symlink: not every tool resolves one.

**After editing either file, copy it over the other — don't repeat the edit by hand:**

```bash
cp CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md   # or the reverse, whichever you just edited
```

Retyping a change is exactly how the two drift; one reflowed line or reworded clause is enough. `diff CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md` must print nothing. If it ever does, treat it as a defect and fix it by letting one file win wholesale — never by merging them.

## What this repo is

`scaffold` is a **GitHub template repository**, not an application. It ships the meta layer (lint, format, commit hooks, CI, CodeQL, Dependabot, release-please, issue/PR templates, standard meta docs) that every new kirchDev repo should start with. There is no application code — the project code can be anything (PHP, Go, Rust, Vue, shell). Only the meta layer lives here.

Implication: when changing files, ask "does this default make sense for _every_ future repo created from this template?" — not just for one project type.

## Commands

| Command             | What it does                                               |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`      | Install deps and wire husky hooks via the `prepare` script |
| `pnpm lint`         | `oxlint . --deny-warnings`                                 |
| `pnpm format`       | `oxfmt --check .` (note: `format` is the check, not fix)   |
| `pnpm typecheck`    | `tsc --noEmit` over the meta scripts                       |
| `pnpm check`        | Runs `lint` + `format` + `typecheck` + `check:policy` — the CI gate |
| `pnpm check:policy` | Proves the two agent policy files ban the same commands    |
| `pnpm lint:fix`     | Auto-fix lint                                              |
| `pnpm format:fix`   | Auto-fix format                                            |
| `pnpm check:fix`    | Auto-fix lint + format                                     |
| `pnpm skills:update`| Update project-scoped agent skills via the skills.sh CLI   |
| `pnpm taze`         | Interactive dependency upgrade check                       |
| `pnpm taze:w`       | Write upgrade results                                      |

There is no test suite — this is config-only. CI runs `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format`, `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm check:policy` on PR.

## Architecture / conventions

- **Node 24, pnpm 11.** Pinned via `.nvmrc`, `engines`, and `packageManager`. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` enforces `minimumReleaseAge=4320` (3-day cooldown), isolated node-linker. Don't loosen these without reason. Package-manager enforcement carries no key on purpose: pnpm 11 replaced `packageManagerStrict`/`packageManagerStrictVersion` with `pmOnFail`, whose default `download` already errors on a foreign package manager and fetches the pinned pnpm version — every other value only weakens it, so leave it unset (the rationale sits as a comment in the file).
- **oxc, not eslint/prettier.** Linting via `oxlint`, formatting via `oxfmt`. Configs live in `.oxlintrc.json` / `.oxfmtrc.json`. `oxlint` uses `unicorn` + `oxc` plugins; rules deliberately minimal.
- **TypeScript, no build step.** The meta scripts and the three tool configs are `.ts` — Node 24 strips types natively, so `scripts/check-policy-parity.ts`, `commitlint.config.ts`, `lint-staged.config.ts` and `taze.config.ts` stay directly executable and each tool loads its own `.ts` config unaided. `tsconfig.json` is `noEmit` + `strict` + `erasableSyntaxOnly`, so only strippable syntax (no enums, no parameter properties) can be written; `pnpm typecheck` is the gate. TypeScript is a devDependency of the template's meta layer only — a downstream PHP, Go or Rust repo inherits it for that and nothing else, and drops it by deleting `tsconfig.json`, the `typecheck` script and the four `.ts` files' types.
- **Husky hooks** (`.husky/pre-commit`, `.husky/commit-msg`) run `lint-staged` and `commitlint`. `lint-staged.config.ts` excludes `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` (free-form prose) and `pnpm-lock.yaml`. `oxlint --fix --deny-warnings` then `oxfmt` on JS/TS; `oxfmt` only on JSON/YAML/MD.
- **Conventional Commits enforced** via `@commitlint/config-conventional`. Don't `--no-verify` unless explicitly asked.
- **release-please is included** (unlike many templates that omit it). Files: `release-please-config.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json`, `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`. Config uses `release-type: simple` (language-agnostic), `include-v-in-tag: true`. Downstream repos start at `0.0.0` and reset via the steps in README → _Resetting release-please_.
- **Workflows** use `actions/checkout@v6`, `actions/setup-node@v6`, `pnpm/action-setup@v6`, `github/codeql-action/{init,analyze}@v4`. Keep these pinned to major versions; Dependabot bumps them monthly.
- **CodeQL** scans `actions` + `javascript-typescript` with `security-extended,security-and-quality` queries, gated by path filters so non-code changes don't trigger it.
- **Dependabot** groups all minor/patch updates per ecosystem into a single PR (`npm-minor-patch`, `actions-minor-patch`). Majors come as separate PRs.

## AI & skills

- **`.claude/settings.json`** ships a baseline permission policy — see _Permission policy_ below for the rules it follows. `.claude/settings.local.json` (per-machine overrides, typically `enabledMcpjsonServers`) is gitignored.
- **`.tituskirch-skills.json`** configures the [TitusKirch skills](https://github.com/TitusKirch/skills) (commit, PR, issue, release, docs …) per repo. It is the runtime **config**, not an installer. Regenerate/reconcile it with the `tituskirch-skills-config` skill.
- **Installing the skills.** The bundle is installed via the skills.sh CLI (`pnpm dlx skills add TitusKirch/skills`), not vendored into the repo. `pnpm skills:update` refreshes project-scoped skills tracked in `skills-lock.json` (only present once a repo actually installs project skills).

## Permission policy

`.claude/settings.json` is deliberately lopsided: a **long `deny` list and a short `allow` list**. The two sides answer different questions, so they follow opposite rules.

**`deny` may be generous.** A rule for a command the repo doesn't have is a no-op, it never needs maintenance, and it is never reviewed — a too-broad block only surfaces when you actually hit it. So the list covers every stack kirchDev repos might grow into (Laravel, Prisma, Terraform/OpenTofu, AWS), not just this one. `git reflog expire` and `git gc --prune=now` are in there because they destroy the rescue path that survives a `reset --hard`.

The line to draw is **the machine or something remote, not the working copy**. Blocked: anything that wrecks the OS (`dd`, `mkfs`, `chmod -R`, `rm -rf /…`), tears down remote state or resources (`terraform destroy`, `state rm`, `aws ec2 terminate-instances`, `gh repo delete`), or throws away work with no recovery path (force-push, `reset --hard`, `stash drop`). Deliberately *not* blocked, because they are ordinary local development: `rm -rf node_modules`, `docker volume rm`, `docker compose down -v`, `docker system prune`, `php artisan tinker`, deleting a remote branch. Those prompt instead — a command that is sometimes wanted belongs in the middle state, never in `deny`.

**`allow` must stay short.** Its only return is fewer prompts — no safety is gained. Every line has to be read and understood by whoever copies this file, and an unreviewed allow list is more dangerous than none. Keep what occurs many times per session (read-only git, `ls`/`grep`/`rg`, the project's own check scripts) and let everything else ask.

**Three states, not two.** A command in `allow` runs unasked; one in `deny` is impossible and has to be typed by hand; one in **neither list prompts you** — and that middle state is the right default for almost everything. Reserve `deny` for what a mistaken "yes" could not undo. A normal `git push` is not that: it is reversible, visible and the ordinary way work ships, so it sits in `allow`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Never allow a rule that runs arbitrary code.** `php artisan tinker --execute`, `pnpm exec turbo run`, `find . *` (which covers `-delete` and `-exec rm`), a raw `pnpm dlx`, or an MCP tool that executes SQL (`database-query`, `run-query`) each hand back everything the `deny` list took away — a blocked `db:wipe` means nothing next to an allowed `tinker --execute 'DB::statement(...)'`. A deny list is only as strong as the weakest allow rule beside it.

Two things this file cannot do, by design: it cannot tell which branch a `git push` targets (protect release branches with **branch protection**, not permissions), and prefix rules miss flags placed before the subcommand (`docker compose -f x.yml down -v`). Treat it as lowering the odds, not as a guarantee.

Downstream repos keep the `deny` list as-is and swap the `pnpm` lines in `allow` for whatever their stack runs.

**Codex gets the same policy** in `.codex/rules/default.rules` — permission config is not portable, so the block list exists twice and **both must be changed together**. Codex uses Starlark `prefix_rule()` calls matching on argument *tokens*, which handles flags and shell chains that the `Bash(…)` prefix patterns miss, and every rule carries its own `match`/`not_match` cases. Check a rule with:

```bash
codex execpolicy check --pretty --rules .codex/rules/default.rules -- git push --force
```

**Parity between the two is machine-checked, not eyeballed.** `pnpm check:policy` (`scripts/check-policy-parity.ts`, part of `pnpm check` and of CI) expands every `prefix_rule` into its concrete argv prefixes — the cartesian product over its alternation lists — and matches the two sets in both directions, so "we changed both files" becomes a number rather than a claim. Two things it encodes are worth knowing before editing either file:

- **The languages differ, so a few gaps cannot be closed.** Claude Code matches a prefix of the command _string_; a `prefix_rule` matches whole argv _tokens_. `Bash(aws iam delete-:*)` therefore bans every delete verb AWS will ever ship, and the Codex side can only enumerate the ones it ships today. Such a difference is legal but must be **declared** — in the `DELIBERATE` list in the script and in the `.codex/rules/default.rules` header — and the check fails both on an undeclared one and on a declaration that has gone stale.
- **Neither language normalises flag order or case.** `rm -rf /` and `rm -fr /` are separate bans; `rm -r -f /` and `redis-cli FlushAll` are neither, and enumerating permutations never ends. The check proves the two files list the **same spellings** — it does not claim the set of spellings is complete. Same caveat as the two below, and for the same reason.

## Branching model

The default here is a **`dev` integration branch**: branch off `dev`, PR into `dev`, roll `dev` up into `main`, and release-please releases from `main`. That is what most kirchDev repos run, so the template runs it too — a variant that ships switched off is a variant nobody notices is broken.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A repo created from this template has the `dev` config but **no `dev` branch**. Create it before the first Dependabot run: with `target-branch: 'dev'` pointing at a branch that doesn't exist, Dependabot opens nothing at all. Going main-only (below) is a deliberate step too — leaving the config untouched is the one option that silently does nothing.

`.github/workflows/dev-pr.yml` opens and updates the rolling draft `dev` → `main` PR. Mark that PR ready and **merge it with a merge commit, never a squash**: squashing collapses the individual `feat:`/`fix:` commits into the PR's own `chore:` title, and release-please then cuts nothing.

Going **main-only** is three edits, all of them removals:

```bash
rm .github/workflows/dev-pr.yml
# .github/dependabot.yml    — drop both `target-branch: 'dev'` lines
# .tituskirch-skills.json   — set `pr.base` to "main"
```

Nothing is vendored for this. A variant worth shipping as files is one that *adds* something — content that would otherwise be lost, the way `dev-pr.yml` itself would be. A variant that only deletes has nothing to preserve, so it stays documented, exactly like _Public vs private repos_ below.

`ci.yml` and `codeql.yml` list both `main` and `dev` in their `on: branches:` filters and neither edit touches them. A filter naming a branch that doesn't exist is a no-op, so it costs a main-only repo nothing — and without `dev` in `ci.yml`, PRs into `dev` (Dependabot's included) would run no CI at all.

Variants that are *purely* deletions — see _Public vs private repos_ below — stay documented rather than vendored; only this one earns the folder.

## Public vs private repos

Some meta defaults only make sense for one visibility. When spinning up a repo from this template, adjust for its visibility:

- **CodeQL / code scanning** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) depends on GitHub Advanced Security. It's free on **public** repos; on a **private** repo without a GHAS license it won't run — delete `codeql.yml` (and the CodeQL note above) rather than leave a dead workflow. The same goes for other GHAS-gated features (secret scanning, etc.). Dependabot version updates work on both.
- **License.** A **public** repo ships MIT: keep `LICENSE` and the `[MIT](LICENSE) © …` README footer. A **private** repo is proprietary: remove/replace `LICENSE`, drop the MIT footer, and set `package.json` to `"license": "UNLICENSED"` (keep `"private": true`).
- **Discord forum links.** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` points questions, ideas and possible bugs at the repo's Discord forum (each open-source repo gets one, provisioned from the `infrastructure` repo's OpenTofu). Confirmed bugs and features stay as the GitHub issue forms. A **private** repo has no forum — drop the `contact_links` block; if you still want an in-repo Q&A path, restore a simple `question.yml`.

## House style for READMEs and meta files

`/write-readme` skill encodes the canonical structure. Key rules: hero block wrapped in `<div align="center">`, prescribed section emojis (✨ Features, 🚀 Setup, 🤝 Contributing, 🛣️ Versioning, 📄 License), license footer always reads `[MIT](LICENSE) © [Titus Kirch](https://github.com/TitusKirch/) / [IT-Dienstleistungen Titus Kirch](https://kirch.dev)`. Use GitHub callouts (`> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`), never plain blockquotes.

## When editing this template

- Every file referencing `TitusKirch/scaffold` is a placeholder that downstream users will replace. Keep the references consistent so a single `grep -rn "TitusKirch/scaffold"` catches them all.
- `forgemap` (sibling repo at `../forgemap`) is the de-facto reference implementation of these conventions. When unsure about a config choice, check what forgemap does.
- The template's own `package.json` is `"private": true` and `"name": "scaffold"` — not published anywhere.
